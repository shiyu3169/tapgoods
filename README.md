### Potential Questions

1. The background image provided does not perfectly match the one showing in the sample.

2. The color codes were not provided, so I choose visually similar colors.

3. The navigation bar was a image (fake nav bar), this is based on the image source provided.

4. There are some smaller image can be used to replace the 2X version for small screen devices, but I prefer to do it within JavaScript.

5. There is no any requirement for mobile versions, the media queries that I made may still have problems.

Thank you for taking your time to read this.
